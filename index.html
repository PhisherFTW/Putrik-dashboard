                <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure your crosshair is on the enemy before shooting</li>
                    <li>When picking positions take into account the weapon you are using and make sure its effective at that position</li>
                    <li>Whenever possible take 1v1 engagments during this match you too a few disadvantageous fights against multiple opponents.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tapping in certain situations feels uncomfortable and not the preferred shooting style</li>
                    <li>spraying seems very comfortable but generally more confident at medium ranges</li>
                    <li>Spraying at close ranges is sometimes overexaggerated which could be contributed to panic and pulldown at close range is a bit slow leading to a few bullets going over the enemy sometimes</li>
                    <li>Sometimes shooting before properly counter-strafing.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes shooting before the crosshair is on the enemy this leads to having to adjust while spraying which is more challenging.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes shooting mid flick or micro-adjustment instead of waiting for the end.</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>armour, B site, nice early rotate on teammates’ info and only fully committing once you have seen bomb, nice flank attempt but you didn’t lineup your shot properly while the enemy wasn’t looking at you. You also reloaded in a very exposed position which allowed the enemy to peek you and this forced you into an unfavourable fight to which you died. L</li>
                    <li>full save, nice rotate lowers, unfortunately you were a little impatient with the rotation and ran a bit too early alerting the enemies to your position which they quickly reacted and killed you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting choice to do the left to right van jump spot, but generally, I recommend the right to left jump spot as you go from a lower position and less of you is exposed when checking apps, good attempt at the retake 1v2 but you whiffed you spray slightly on the first engagement by slightly overflicking to the left, but good confidence and to go continue to go for the retake which allowed you to kill the awper, unfortunately the enemy you had your first engagement with played around the smoke well and managed to catch you off-gaurd. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice use of range with the Deagle and good confidence fighting mid, good movement to get out of the left side snipers nest otherwise you could have taken a lot of nade damage which came in later. Later on in the round you got squeezed in jungle getting peeked from jungle and ladderroom. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice rotation from B but you were too focused on dropping utility which left you out in the open allowing you to take significant damage from an enemy peeking, then with super low HP you peeked top stairs which is completely exposed to numerous angles and you then got peeked from palace which was one of the numerous angles. L</li>
                    <li>mp9 buy, good positioning short playing the close range angle, although it seemed you were not confident in your SMG spray which led to you bursting even at close range and this allowed the enemy to turn around and kill you. L </li>
                    <li>Deagle, nice rotate from B, I would not recommend peeking top stairs on a regular basis but you learnt from your previous mistake and instead chose a significantly better angle inside connector to peek palace this allowed you to shoot without too much danger, you heard the enemy rotating from middle but your decision to change positions put you in a disadvantage because it left you out in the open and you died, I would have recommended playing safer and to a closer angle instead of trying to cross to the other side of connector which you didn’t have time for. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, I liked your positioning on the belcony but you peeked too early, good job getting 1 kill but a little more patience would have gone a long way in allowing you to have more impact on this round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting choice to use utility towards bench when your teammates’ confirmed chair was low but still good utility thrown although enemies’ positions were not confirmed in this position, interesting apps hold position slightly overexposed and not playing very close to a corner but you were not punished during this round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Slight miscommunication from your teammate as during the first few seconds B was left entirely open but that was quickly resolved when you fell back to hold apps, nice position under window and good impact killing 2 enemies well done, you did your job this round perfectly. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, miscommunication again with Orange wanting to do a short peek and not properly communicating leading to you having to go A late, during the A take you could have assisted more from jungle earlier but instead decided to rotate which was a nice decision to backup your solo awper CT, and you managed to get 2 kills to help secure the round so well done. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, during this round you were overly focused on short leaving apps completely open, this could have easily gotten you and your teammate punished but fortunately, there was no flank, great prefire on the enemy holding short from bottom con on the right, and good gamesence to drop the smoke and stick while teammate dealt with the remaining enemies good job sticking and solid overall fight. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at playing short but you got overly confident and tried use Line of sight utility which should be avoided the vast majority of the time unless necessary, this ended up causing you to take an unexpected fight against someone peeking bench which gave them the advantage allowing them to kill you. W</li>
                    <li>p250, dangerous position short as you were extremely vulnerable to lowers peek and a normal short peek try keeping all engagements within the optimal range for your weapon and when at all possible try to surprise your enemy by holding a simple angle this allowed them to peek but if you hid first and then peeked after they thought it was clear this would have given you a bigger advantage in the fight. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good movement up short and solid backup to kill the enemy going chair nice reaction to molly the bomb, good teamwork to rotate to B but unfortunate wiff on the enemy going up stairs because of the awkward angle this led to you doing a significant amount of damage but to the legs. W</li>
                    <li>T side pistol armour, B contact, overall a solid strat but it seemed they were ready for this having multiple teammates on site, unfortunately, due to your stagnant movement while pushing through apps this made it easy for the enemies to lineup a headshot on you while you were still in apps to help avoid this issues I recommend jumping and focusing on closing the distance to the enemy. l</li>
                    <li>p250, interesting info position TV room, solid movement up ramp and nice communication to give the weapon to the teammate with more HP, unfortunately your teammate had a weird idea about you jumping to stairs instead of focusing on clearing out angles and getting bomb down which was more important. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, dangerous engagement early on A leads to you dying early without the possibility for your death to be traded. L</li>
                    <li>Tec-9, good job picking up a teammates’ AK, and solid play pushing through window and jungle to kill the enemy in connector unfortunately you forgot about the enemy you had spotted earlier on short who ended up fighting you and your teammate. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good positioning and timing moving up from lowers and solid peek into middle catching the enemy peeking bottom stairs to ramp off-guard and good reaction to kill the awper and solid after plant positioning Jungle watching death-hole / Ladder room and somewhat connector, overall solid triple kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good information calling you heard them pushing but you went overly agro pushing back to meet them and you ended up being triple peeked by their light buy and died without too much impact. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good information calling probably a middle push but again you were caught out in the open and this was possibly over confident, although you did manage to get 1 kill which was solid if you had played safer you could have secured a second. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Teammates calls forced you to focus on one angle which was short while accidentally exposing yourself to connector which is where the enemy peeked from. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, {{Timeout}}, solid middle take which is nice and slow and methodical with good utility usage, interesting idea to rotate to B this late in the round with only 10 seconds left while in apps, unfortunately there wasn’t enough time but good job getting the kill on the enemy there and staying alive. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, first time going palace, nice quick trade for your teammate by killing the enemy connector, good idea and attempt at killing the enemy ticket unfortuantely he was able to dodge the flash and was expecting your peek. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unfortunate timing on the peek palace as that was when the enemy holding palace decided to peek with an SMG and at that range and that position the enemy had the advantage in that engagement as you were not expecting him to be there. L</li>
                    <li>Tec 9 buy, good attempt at entrying B but unforutane movement off the balcony which led to you taking a single negative engagement. L</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game,did you get the positions you wanted? and were you comfortable in real life? <br> IRL a little uncomfortable (new glasses and back hurts) , a few rounds felt really good but most of the time just filling in the gaps. </li>
                    <li>How did your crosshair placement feel? <br> Felt like hardly ever as I was too busy thinking about other things.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during flicks? <br> Mostly the close quarters felt uncomfortable but the wider swipes felt better </li>
                    <li>How did your overall aim mechanics feel, like spraying, preaiming, peeking angles ect? <br> 3.5/10 especially with peeking and overthinking engagements.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br> Felt quite okay, and only a few times when I was too slow as I was usually the B anchor. </li>
                    <li>How did your positioning feel? <br> Yea I over peeked a couple time, I tend to overpeek in super close quarter combat and sometimes, the fights that I did take felt alrgith I just wasn’t hitting my shots</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br> Especially my flashes are below average </li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving correct information? <br> Overall 7.5 / 10 and only occasional wrong calls and there was a time when I didn’t give enough info and there wasn’t as much info to give. </li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> No </li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br> Too much in my own head and think more about the flashes I am throwing.</li>
